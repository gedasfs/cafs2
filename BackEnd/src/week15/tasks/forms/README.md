## Configuring
In order to run the application locally, but not in the server root dir (i.e. /var/www), project directory should be set in configs/dirs.php -> PROJECT_DIR in respect to server root directory,
i.e., if the project is copied to /var/www/projects/current_project/ then project directory should be set as /projects/current_project/
